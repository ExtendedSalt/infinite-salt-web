    "hydec":"Hyperinvestment doesn’t necessarily refer to spending money on the game, but rather high resource and time investment targeted at perfecting a character or team. What the Golden House seeks to nurture is pushing the limits of what’s possible in Genshin Impact and to explore the ceilings of every character in the game. Forget about cost efficiency – this is the place for anyone interested in bringing out the very best of specific characters, no matter what it takes!",
    "speedrunning":"Speedrunning",
    "speedrundec":"At the highest level of investment, the question often isn’t whether you can clear the content in this game or not, but rather how fast you can clear it. Speedrunning challenges the boundaries of both resource dedication and player skill, making it a prime testing ground to observe the fruits of hyperinvestment. The Speedrunning section accepts speedrun submissions across various speedrunning categories, such as Spiral Abyss and Domain runs. It is also dedicated to theorycrafting speedrun strategies to get the lowest times possible."
